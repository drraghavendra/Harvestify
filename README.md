Harvestify
HArvestify is an open-source, Arduino-based precision agriculture platform that helps farmers monitor and optimize their crops. It uses a network of sensors to collect data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light levels. This data is then transmitted to a central server, where it is analyzed and used to generate recommendations for irrigation, fertilization, and other crop management practices.

Components:

Arduino Uno or compatible board
Soil moisture sensor
Temperature sensor
Humidity sensor
Light sensor
SD card shield
Ethernet shield or Wi-Fi shield
Jumper wires
Breadboard
PVC pipe
Stakes
Assembly:

Connect the soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, and light sensor to the Arduino board according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Connect the SD card shield to the Arduino board.
Connect the Ethernet shield or Wi-Fi shield to the Arduino board.
Mount the sensors in PVC pipes and stake them into the ground near your crops.
Connect the jumper wires to connect the sensors, shields, and Arduino board.
Code:

The code for the HArvestify project can be found on the HArvestify website. The code collects data from the sensors, stores it on the SD card, and transmits it to the central server.

Data analysis:

The data collected by the HArvestify project can be used to generate recommendations for irrigation, fertilization, and other crop management practices. The data can also be used to track the progress of crops over time and to identify potential problems.

Benefits:

The HArvestify project can help farmers to:

Increase crop yields
Reduce water usage
Reduce fertilizer usage
Improve crop quality
Make better informed decisions about their crops
Additional notes:

The HArvestify project is a relatively complex project. If you are not familiar with Arduino, it is recommended that you start with a simpler project first.
The HArvestify project is open-source, so you can modify the code and hardware to meet your specific needs.
There are a number of other open-source precision agriculture platforms available, so you may want to compare them to HArvestify before you decide which one to use.
